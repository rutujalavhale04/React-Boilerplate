These pouches offered numerous advantages over traditional packaging materials such as bottles and blisters, particularly in terms of cost savings, convenience, and product protection.

Several key trends are expected to influence the demand for these pouches:</p><ul> <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> With the growing emphasis on reducing environmental impact, pharmaceutical companies are expected to favor eco-friendly pouches made from recyclable or biodegradable materials.
